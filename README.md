# stock_project
A project to analysis a stock by comparing it to the SNP 500.

I was going to use the DOW aswell but the nubers I was getting inthe call from google where not matching
   googles stock tracker. 
   
I had used yahoo's API and liked it. I had the adjested close that google does not but the lst few times 
   I tryed I could not get the data. I was told they stoped maintaing that serviec but can not varify byoned 
   that I have not gotten it to work.
