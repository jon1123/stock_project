# stock_project
A project to analyze a stock by comparing it to the SNP 500.
   
I had used Yahoo's API and liked it. I had the adjusted closing that Google does not but the last few times 
   I tried I could not get the data. I was told they stopped maintaining that service but can not verify beyond 
   that I have not gotten it to work.
